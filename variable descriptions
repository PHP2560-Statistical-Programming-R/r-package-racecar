* BPS stands for "brake pressure sensor", which is the pressure of the brake fluid. (changes as drives stomps on brakes)
* PE3_RPM is the engine RPM
* TPS is the throttle position sensor, which measures how much the gas pedal is depressed
* Fuel_Time is a measure of how much fuel is injected on each stroke
* IGN_ANG has to do with spark timing
* BARO is a barometer data at the datalogger
* MAP is "manifold air pressure", which is the pressure inside of the intake system.
* Lambda is a measure of air/fuel ratio in the exhaust
*ANA_IN are analog inputs, and I don't *think* they are currently used, though I'm not sure.
*FREQ1-4 are the rotational speeds of the wheels (I'd have to check which is which)
*SPS is steering position sensor. It's connected to the steering column and tells us how much we are turning.
* Slip ratio is a measure of front vs. rear wheel speed.
