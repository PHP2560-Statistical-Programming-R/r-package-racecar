For this project we will create an R package that manipulates the csv output from Racestudio2. These csvs contain car race data from the Brown Formula Racing endurance laps (speed, throttle, acceleration, GPS position, oil pressure, braking, RPM, gear, etc). 

We will create functions that easily complete the following tasks:

Blain:

Cleans/Merges csv files among laps

Graph that looks at speed across GPS coordinates

Fuyu:

Graph of RPM vs Speed

Graph that compares lap speed

Graph that compares speed among driver

Jess:

Histograms with engine RPM

Graphs of throttle position

Graphs of braking pattern

R Package Proposal
For this project we will make an R package to help students in introductory epidemiology courses with functions that create 2x2 tables, calculate common association measures based on various user inputs such as sample size, incidence, prevalence, etc. The output of the function will also include the interpretation of the measure. 

Fuyu Zou:
Risk Ratio 
Odds Ratio 
Attributable Risk 
Risk Difference 

Blain Morin:
Incidence
Prevalence
Sensitivity
Specificity
PPV
NPV

Jess Kaminsky:
Chi-squared test 
Confidence Intervals 
Create 2X2 Table 
Simulate growth

SHINY APP PROPOSAL

What your app will do?
Our Epidemiology_101 app will use our R package to calculate and interpret important measures of association from user inputted values in a 2x2 table. It will also allow users to simulate spread of disease, run chi-squared hypothesis tests and calculate confidence intervals. 

How do you see it being used?
Our app will make it easy to calculate measures of interpretation and to verify that the measures of association are being correctly interpreted. 

What types of options might you try to included for the user.
Type of study,  sample size, confidence level, parameters for spread of disease
