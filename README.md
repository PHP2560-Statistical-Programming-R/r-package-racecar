R Package Proposal: 
For this project we will create an R package that manipulates the csv output from Racestudio2. These csvs contain car race data from the Brown Formula Racing endurance laps (speed, throttle, acceleration, GPS position, oil pressure, braking, RPM, gear, etc). 

We will create functions that easily complete the following tasks:

Blain:

Cleans/Merges csv files among laps

Graph that looks at speed across GPS coordinates

Fuyu:

Graph of RPM vs Speed

Graph that compares lap speed

Graph that compares speed among driver

Jess:

Histograms with engine RPM

Graphs of throttle position

Graphs of braking pattern
