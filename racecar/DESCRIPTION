Description: USE OF THE PACKAGE:*BLAIN DESCRIBE WHAT THE PACAKGE IS USED FOR*CREATING THE PACKAGE: In creating this package, our group first wrote a set of functions that manipulated and plotted data from racestudio2 output. We used a textbook "Making Sense of Squiggly Lines: The Basic Analysis of Race Car Data Acquisition" to help determine which graphs would be the most useful for individuals working with racecar data. After determining the most useful functions, we organized all of our functions into one R file and used RStudio to help design the file structure for our package. We decided to use a single file format because it seemed simpler to have all of our functions stored in one file.INDIVIDUAL ROLES:BLAIN: provided the software, data, and idea for project, helped write the clean data functions, wrote oilpressure, airfuel, and mapseed functions, wrote documentation files for oilpressure, airfuel, and mapspeed functionsFUYU: helped write the clean data functions,JESS: helped write the clean data functions, wrote throttle position and braking pattern functions, set up file layout for package, wrote documentation file for cleaning data, throttle, and braking functions
